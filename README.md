#Simple Game

#Created by Jeffrey Ilar

##Problem statement:
Implement a single screen/level from a simple game in Unity. 

* Have items you can pick up: Coins, Rings, whatever. At least three of them
* Should look good (simple art is okay)
* Some sort of AI (random or repetitive motion is okay) Example: an enemy bot moving randomly and causes the player to die when in contact.
* Extra credit: More complex collision detection than picking up an item or being destroyed. Example: more complex things like lives, animations, multiple AIs, AI chases the player when close, AI varies speed when spots the player, Health, Points system (get creative)
* Feel free to use online Unity resources for reference. Never copy-paste code from online forums. You can however, reference any online forum for help.

##Grading rubrics( 5 points each):
* Is the game fun to play
* Does the game run properly and **does not have bugs**
* Does the game look good. Simple meaningful art is ok
* Extra credit: (Look at the extra credit section in the description above.)

## Notes
* Use Unity version 5.5.1 for this project. Never use Beta versions for projects. If you have to use a lower version, it may be ok. But DO NOT use a higher version than 5.5.1
* A .gitignore has been added for your convenience
* Please add your project into the private repository assigned to you. **The project should not be in a sub folder.** Look at this repository structure for reference: https://github.com/csc631-831-spring-2017/Breakout-sample
* Make sure your project compiles and runs. **There are heavy penalties if your code doesn't compile**.(Look at the next point)
* The course staff are going to use scripts to build and output an executable from your project. Staff will directly run the game and grade as per the rubric.
* Make sure your last push is before the deadline. Your last push will be considered as your final submission.
* If you need to be considered for partial grade/extension for any serious or compelling reason. Then email the staff before the deadline. Late email requests may not be considered.
* Post questions on Piazza if you have any questions.
* Please contact the course staff if you run into issues. We are here to help you!
